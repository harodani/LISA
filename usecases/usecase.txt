Use case 1

Lisa wants to travel from Uppsala to Stockholm.
The train starts moving. Lisa is bored and wants to check
the news before she gets to work. She starts the application
and browses for "www.dn.se". The application sends the Lisa's request
to the local NRS that is situated on the same train. 
The NRS receives the request and returns devices that
previously had downloaded the same webpage. Lisa's application
will then start to check which devices are still on the train, so that
it can connect to one of those and try to retrieve the webpage
via Bluetooth. Lisa can now see the webpage she asked for. At this point,
Lisa's device will inform the NRS that it can serve the webpage to other devices.

Use case 2

Later on Olle sits on the same train as Lisa. He is already using
the application for browsing "www.dn.se".
